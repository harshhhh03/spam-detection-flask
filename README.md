## 📌 Problem Statement
Spam messages are a common issue in SMS and email communication, leading to wasted time and potential security risks.  
This project aims to **automatically detect spam messages** using Machine Learning techniques.

---

## 🧠 Solution Overview
The system uses **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and **Machine Learning classification** to analyze message text and predict whether it is spam.

### Workflow:
1. User enters a message in the web interface  
2. Text is converted into numerical features using **TF-IDF Vectorizer**  
3. A trained **Naive Bayes classifier** predicts the category  
4. Result is displayed instantly on the web page
